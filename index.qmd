This problem set spans approximately 5-6 weeks of class time and corresponds to the full scope of Module 1.
The difficulty level reflects this substantial time commitment.

## Provided

- Daily precipitation data for Houston-area stations 
- Boilerplate Quarto template with data loading and basic plotting functions
- `util.jl` file from the labs is available for use
- Code from previous labs for analysis

### Julia Package Installation

You will need to install Julia packages for this assignment. To do this:

1. Open the Julia REPL
2. Type `]` to enter package mode  
3. Install packages with `add PackageName` (e.g., `add GeoMakie CSV DataFrames Turing`)

**Note:** The packages listed above are examples. Check the lab files to see which specific packages you need for your analysis. If you try to run code that uses a package you haven't installed, you'll get an error like `ArgumentError: Package PackageName not found in current path`.

## Tasks

1. Stationary GEV Analysis (ready after Lab 4)
   - Select one Houston-area station for primary analysis throughout tasks 1, 3, 4
   - Extract annual maximum daily precipitation from station data (provided)
   - Implement MLE using Turing.jl with `optimize(model, MAP())` workflow; benchmark results against `Extremes.jl` for validation
   - Implement Bayesian GEV inference using MCMC with `Turing.jl`; specify and justify physically-informed priors for location, scale, and shape parameters based on Houston climate knowledge
   - Compare posterior distributions to MLE results and ensure convergence
   - Calculate and plot 50-year and 100-year return period estimates with posterior uncertainty bounds

2. Multi-station Regional Analysis (ready after Lab 4)
   - Repeat Task 1 for 4 additional Houston-area stations using identical methods
   - Create summary table comparing 50-year return level estimates across stations
   - Plot time series of all 5 stations on same axes to visualize synchronous behavior

3. Nonstationarity Detection (ready after nonstationarity lecture - Mon 9/22)
   - Using a 20-year rolling window analysis, plot the estimated 100-year return level over time for your primary station
   - Conduct Mann-Kendall trend test on annual maxima; report test statistic, p-value, and interpretation
   - Repeat nonstationarity analysis for all 5 stations and create summary table comparing trend test p-values

4. Nonstationary GEV Modeling (ready after nonstationarity lecture - Mon 9/22)
   - Fit GEV model with time-varying location parameter: $\mu(t) = \mu_0 + \beta \cdot t$ for your selected station
   - Compare covariate options: (a) year, (b) temperature index for location parameter only
   - Compare models using multiple criteria: AIC/BIC, posterior predictive performance, parameter interpretability, and robustness to outliers
   - Which model would you trust most for infrastructure design and why? Consider trade-offs between model complexity and trustworthiness
   - Generate return level plots showing how 50-year event changes over time under best model
   - Quantify change in 50-year return level from 1970 to 2023 with 90% credible intervals

5. Hierarchical Bayesian Regional Pooling (ready after Lab 5)
   - Implement partial pooling hierarchical model with station-level parameters drawn from regional hyperpriors
   - Compare posterior uncertainty in 50-year return levels: station-specific vs pooled estimates
   - Show shrinkage effects for one station with short record

6. Communication (can be drafted throughout)
   - Write exactly 2 paragraphs (150-200 words each) responding to this scenario: "A senior infrastructure engineer argues that 50 years of local data provides sufficient information for design and that climate models add unnecessary complexity and uncertainty."
   - Paragraph 1: Address uncertainty quantification - explain how Bayesian methods and regional pooling actually reduce parameter uncertainty compared to single-station MLE
   - Paragraph 2: Address model selection and risk - discuss evidence for nonstationarity and practical implications of underestimating future extreme events for infrastructure design
   - Reference specific results from your model comparison, prior specification, and uncertainty analysis to make concrete technical arguments
